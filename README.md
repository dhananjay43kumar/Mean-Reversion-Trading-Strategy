# Mean-Reversion-Trading-Strategy

Mean reversion, or reversion to the mean, is a theory used in finance that suggests that asset price volatility and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset.

This mean level can appear in several contexts such as economic growth, the volatility of a stock, a stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), or the average return of an industry.

Reversion to the mean involves retracing a condition back to its long-run average state. The concept assumes that a level that strays far from the long-term norm or trend will again return, reverting to its understood state or secular trend.

This theory has led to many investing strategies that involve the purchase or sale of stocks or other securities whose recent performances have differed greatly from their historical averages. However, a change in returns also could be a sign that a company no longer has the same prospects it once did, in which case it is less likely that mean reversion would occur.

Percentage returns and prices are not the only measures considered in mean reverting; interest rates or even the P/E ratio of a company can be subject to this phenomenon.
